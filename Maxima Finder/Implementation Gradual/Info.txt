Working implementation for placing the cameras at the highest values within the difference matrix, wihtout recaclulating
the difference matrix after each placement. 

Improvements:

    - Buffer area in which only one camera is allowed to be placed (maybe depending on city size). This becomes
      especially important, when smaller field numbers are chosen.
    - A similiar implementation, that does not utilise a difference matrix might perform worse when placing cameras,
      but would be significantly faster.
